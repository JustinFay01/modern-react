### Vs Code Folder

The `extensions.json` file is used to recommend extensions to anyone who opens the workspace. This can be very useful for team environments where you want to ensure that all members have the same set of tools and capabilities by recommending the extensions they should install.

### Why React + Vite + TypeScript

We chose React, Vite, and TypeScript for this guide because they are a powerful combination that offers a modern development experience. React is a popular library for building user interfaces, Vite is a fast build tool that leverages modern browser features, and TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that helps catch errors early in the development process.

If you aren't familiar with Vite check out the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/) as well as [Vite in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCrXgy8qtjM).

#### Alternatives

- **React**: Other popular libraries for building user interfaces include `Angular` and `Vue.js`.
- **Vite**: Alternatives to Vite include `Webpack`, `Parcel`, and `Snowpack`.
